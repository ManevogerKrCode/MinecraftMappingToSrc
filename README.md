When its done, you should see **"Gradle Tasks"** Tab at the bottom. Just expand **"mcp-reborn"** file.

Okay, now we first need to expand **"mcp"** and Press **"setup"**. Wait until execution done.

Then, Expand **"mcp"** file again and Press **"copyAssets"**. Wait until execution done.

**DONE, JUST PUT THAT JAR FILE TO "1.20.4test" FOLDER AND PUT THAT FOLDER TO appdata -> roaming -> .minecraft -> versions **

# Troubleshooting

**When i change the client-extra.jar, the game wont open**

This happens because the Minecraft checks the files, you can fix it by just watching the video:

Follow the path that is in the right of client-extra.jar file, im on linux so thats why its different than Windows.


Sorry for glitches in the videos, i will fix it asap.
